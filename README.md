## How to run the app

### Two methods:

__Running locally:__
Note: to run the app locally, you must first install [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and either `npm` or [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) (`npm` comes packaged with `Node.js`)
1. Open a terminal and go to the directory where the app's code is
2. Enter the command `npm install` or `yarn` to install dependencies
3. Enter the command `npm start` or `yarn start` to start the server
4. Open a browser (Chrome preferred) and navigate to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)
5. The app will open in the browser

_OR_

__Running remotely:__
1. Open a browser (Chrome preferred) and navigate to [`https://comp3981-abalone.web.app/`](https://comp3981-abalone.web.app/)
2. The app will open in the browser

## How to use import a `.input` input file and download the `.move` and `.board` output files

1. Open the app using one of the two methods outlined above in __How to run the app__
2. Click on the folder (üìÅ) icon at the top right of the screen
3. Find and choose one or more `.input` files in your computer's file system and click `OK`
4. Your browser will download a `.move` and a `.board` file for each `.input` file you imported into your Downloads folder (or wherever you have set up your browser to download files)

# For development -- Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
